  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements. REQ-1 is implemented through the useGrantAdminPrivileges hook in useQueries.ts and the AdminSetupPage that calls this hook. REQ-2 is implemented through conditional rendering logic in AccountDashboardPage that shows Stripe settings to admin users based on useIsCallerAdmin hook. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",

      "description": "Admin role assignment functionality in AdminUserManagementPage allowing granting/revoking admin privileges for other users",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest scope is limited to granting admin privileges to the current user only. The diff shows AdminUserManagementPage.tsx (mentioned in frontend-file-summaries.txt) with role assignment buttons to grant or revoke admin privileges for any registered artist, which extends beyond the single-user admin grant requirement.",

      "description": "Admin setup guidance banner with navigation button in AccountDashboardPage for non-admin users",
      "reason": "While this supports the user flow, the BuildRequest did not explicitly request UI guidance or navigation prompts for non-admin users to discover the admin setup functionality. The diff shows a showAdminSetup condition that displays a blue banner with Grant Admin Access button.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest did not specify automatic navigation behavior after granting privileges. The diff shows AdminSetupPage includes automatic redirect to account dashboard after 2 seconds and a useEffect that redirects if already admin.",
