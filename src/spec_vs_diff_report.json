  "summary": "The implementation covers most core requirements including artist profiles, job marketplace, gigs marketplace, bookings system, and product store with Stripe integration. However, several key acceptance criteria are missing or only partially implemented: no evidence of artist profile editing, no availability calendar for bookings, incomplete shopping cart functionality (can add but cannot complete purchases for products separate from Stripe checkout), and no booking notifications system. The visual design with warm earth tones is implemented via Tailwind CSS configuration. Generated image assets are referenced but their actual generation/presence is not confirmed in the diff.",
