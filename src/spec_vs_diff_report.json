  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all core requirements for batch product upload in ProductManagementPage. A new BatchProductUpload component was created with file selection, validation, editable fields with preset defaults, batch creation logic using createProduct, and comprehensive toast notifications. The ProductManagementPage was modified to integrate the batch upload dialog. All 5 requirements (REQ-70 through REQ-74) appear to be implemented based on the available diff evidence.",
