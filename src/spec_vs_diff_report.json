  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements: REQ-9 adds a Payment Settings card to the AccountDashboardPage that links to admin Stripe settings, and REQ-10 adds a grantAdminPrivileges backend function with corresponding frontend hooks. However, there are issues with REQ-9's implementation regarding accessibility and navigation target.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Card is visible to all authenticated users",
      "reason": "The Payment Settings card in AccountDashboardPage is conditionally rendered only when isAdmin is true, making it visible only to admins rather than all authenticated users as specified",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/AccountDashboardPage.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Clicking the card navigates to the payment settings page",
      "reason": "The card links to '/admin/stripe-settings' (admin-specific page) rather than a general 'payment settings page' accessible to all users. The requirement implies a user-facing payment settings page, but the implementation only provides admin access",
