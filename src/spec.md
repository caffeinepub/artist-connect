# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make Stripe settings accessible from the user panel and grant admin access to the current user on the live deployment.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Stripe Settings/Payment Settings navigation card to the AccountDashboardPage that links to the payment settings page
- Grant admin privileges to the current authenticated user on the live production deployment

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a Stripe Settings card in their account dashboard that navigates to payment settings. The current user will have admin access to view and manage Stripe configuration on the live site.
